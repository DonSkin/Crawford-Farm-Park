We are a family run petting farm with over 100 animals including Pygmy Goats, Alpacas, Sheep, Fallow Deer, Rheas, Pigs, Goats, Rabbits, Guinea Pigs, Ducks, Miniature Pony, Chickens, Miniature Donkeys & Wallabies. You can purchase a bucket of feed at the ticket hut and feed most of the animals, the feed is a pellet made from grass so is suitable for most animals with exception of the rabbits and guinea pigs as they are prone to over eating. We are an interactive farm and petting the animals is allowed, with exception of the pigs as they are prone to nipping. If you are unsure ask a member of staff or look for the advice signs on all fences. 

There is plenty of outdoor and undercover seating to sit down and relax while watching your children or have a picnic. 

Within the Petting Farm we have a trim trail and a sensory area for the children, wooden climbing areas and a giant swing.

Please note children must be supervised at all times â€“ on the Farm, in the Play Barn and on the outdoor play equipment.
